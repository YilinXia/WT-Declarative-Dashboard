[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/YilinXia/WT_Declarative_Dashboard/master?urlpath=lab/tree/widgyts_PR.ipynb)

## Project Overview
This project will explore developing a custom front-end for volumetric (i.e., astrophysical, oceanographic, weather, finite element) data accessible to Whole Tale. This will include developing a dashboard of analysis methods on these datasets, and utilizing existing open source libraries for exposing methods to individuals. The final result will be both a dashboard and a downloadable set of machine-readable representations of the current state of the dashboard, which can be re-ingested as a secondary tale.
 
## Repo Introduction
This repo will be used to store all the necessary files or scripts regarding the project described above.
 
**Milestone 1** Launch PR "dataset viewver" in Jupyter Lab with Voila

Here, we use binder (which containing repo2docker)to test our environement settings and later we will put all shell scripts from folder **"binder"** to set up the environment in WT.
